### THM (Hoffman, Kruskal)
Suppose that $A$ is TUM (that is, the determinant of each submatrix $\in\{0,\pm 1\}$), then for arbitrary integral vector $b$
$$P=\{x\mid AX\le b\}$$
is an intergral polyhedron

***Proof***: We only need to show that every vertex solution of $P$ is integral. Note that a definition of vertex solution all $x$ such that $A'x=b'$, where $A'$ is a square submatrix of $X$ and $b'$ is the corresponding subvector of $b$. Thus $x=A'^{-1}b'$, which is integral because $A'$ is integral due to the property of TUM

**Thm (Ghouila-Houri)** 
$A_{m\times n}$ is TUM iff for arbitrary subset $R\subseteq [m]$, there exists a partition $R_1\cup R_2$ of $R$ such that $\sum_{i\in R_1}a_{ij}-\sum_{i\in R_2}a_{ij}\in\{0,\pm 1\}$, for arbitrary $j$.
