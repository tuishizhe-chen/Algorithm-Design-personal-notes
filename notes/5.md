### Tree decomposition and tree-width
***Tree decomposition*** for graph $G$ is a corresponding tree $T$ whose vertices are sets consisting of vertices of $G$, let $t$ s denote vertices of $T$, and $V_t$ denotes the corresponding set of $t$. $T$ should satisfy the following properties:
- each vertex is contained by some $T_t$ s
- each edge is contained by some $T_t$ s
- (*Coherence*) let $t_1,t_2,t_3\in T$, where $t_2$ lies on the unique path from $t_1$ to $t_3$. If $v\in V_{t_1}\cap V_{t_3}$, then $v\in V_{t_2}$
  
Tree decomposition is not unique, we use $tw(T)$ to denote $\max_{t\in T}(|V_t|-1)$, then the ***tree width*** of $G$ is defined by $\min_{T \text{ is a decomposition}}tw(T)$.

Here are two lemmas:

- Suppose $T-t$ has components $T_1,\dots,T_k$, then $G_{T_1},\dots,G_{T_k}$ have no nodes in common and no edges between them.
- Suppose $t_1,t_2\in T$ are two adjacent bags, then deleting $V_{t_1}\cap V_{t_2}$ disconnects $G$ into more than 1 component.

Unfortunately, $\min(tw(T))$ is NP-hard.

### Max-weight independent set with tree decomposition

Let $T$ be a tree decomposition of $G$, direct $T$ with root $\tau$, for an arbitrary vertex $t\in T$, let $T_t$ be the subtree of $T$ with root $t$. Let $G_t$ or $G_{T_t}$ be the sub-graph of $G$ which is generated by all vertices in some $V_{t'}$s in $T_t$. For an arbitrary independent set $U\subset V_t$, let $f_t(U)$ denote the max-weight independent set $S$ of $G_t$, subject to the requirement that $S\cap V_t=U$.

We can use the **DP-method** to compute $f_t(U)$. In fact, 
$f_t(U)=w(U)+\sum_{t_i}\max(f_{t_i}(U_i):U_i\cap V_t=U\cap V_{t_i}, U_i\text{ is IS of } T_{t_i})$, where $t_i$ s are all sons of $t$ in $T$.

### Minor 
***Minor***: a minor of a graph $G$ can be obtained by the following operations:
- **Contraction:** For connected vertices $u,v$, delete them and create a new vertex $w$ whose $N(w)=N(u)\cap N(v)$
- **Deletion:** delete a vertex (and its corresponding edges) or an edge 

A graph family $\mathcal{F}$ is called ***minor-closed*** if $G\in\mathcal{F}\rightarrow \text{minors of }G\in\mathcal{F}$.

### NP-Completeness
We say **$Y\le_pX$**, if $Y$ is poly-time solvable with the assumption that $X$ is poly-time solvable.

Example:

**Set cover (SC):** $U$ with a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $U$'s subsets. Whether there is a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{F}$ with size $k$ such that the union of sets in $\mathcal{C}$ is the entire $U$.

VC(vertex cover) $\le_p$ SC.
